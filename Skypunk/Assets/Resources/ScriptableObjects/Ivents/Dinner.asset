  TextHeader: THE DINNER IS SERVED
  Text: You hear screams from over the hill on the island "Food, mouthwatering, delicious
    food for fuel". When you reach the source of the noise, you notice a figure under
    the tent and a modestly laid table in front of him. He offers to sit down at
    the table and discuss the details of the exchange.
  VarA: Sit down
  TextA: You get some fuel out of the ship and sit down at the table. The figure
    enthusiastically shouts "The dinner is served." However you manage to escape
    from the trap of cannibals leaving unloaded fuel (Fuel -2).
