  Text: The crew meets two merchants on the island who accuse each other of stealing
    goods. You watch them closely, one of them is well dressed and of a fairly full
    build, the other is thin and does not look much like a merchant in attire.
  VarA: Support a plump one
  TextA: You think that the second merchant is more like a thief, and you help drive
    him away. In return, the merchant thanks you and wishes you a safe journey.

    you a reward.
